// relay entirely and connections fail behind strict firewalls or symmetric NAT.

// through to us, we punch back. Improves NAT traversal success rate.

// ListenPort is the default UDP port for the Nebula agent. A fixed port
// (vs port 0 / random) is critical for NAT hole punching — it keeps the

// TunMTU is the MTU for the Nebula TUN interface in kernel mode.
